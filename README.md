# Advanced Minesweeper JS
This repository contains an advanced Minesweeper web application built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game challenges players to clear a minefield without detonating any mines and offers multiple difficulty levels to test their skills.

## Getting Started
To play the game, you can simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The game interface will be displayed in the browser window, and you can select the difficulty level to start playing.

## Features
- Multiple difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)
- Random minefield generation
- Interactive user interface
- Time tracking
- Flagging system

## Gameplay
The game displays a minefield of tiles, some of which contain mines. The player must clear the minefield by uncovering tiles and avoiding the mines. The number displayed on each tile represents the number of mines in the surrounding tiles.

The player can use the flagging system to mark tiles they suspect contain mines. The game ends when the player clears all non-mine tiles or detonates a mine. The time taken to clear the minefield is recorded and displayed at the end of the game.
